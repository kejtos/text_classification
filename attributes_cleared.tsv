It also gives information about the anticipated delivery date, delivery address, payment terms, and other terms and logistics of the sale.Total Cost
1343177	A purchase order is a business document that’s initiated by a buyer and sent to a seller. It contains a summary of the Product or services (as well as the price) that a buyer will purchase from a seller. So that there’s no confusion it’s essential that a buyer is explicit about what their requests are – so the seller completely understands what’s expected.
1343178	A defined geographical area within its borders can sales person or sales team operate.
1343179	Sales growth is a business term that indicates the ability to increase sales revenue from one fiscal period to another.
1343180	Net sales are the total sales generated by a company, excluding any sales returns, allowances, and discounts. It is an important figure and is used by analysts when making decisions about the business or analyzing a company’s top-line growth.
1343181	The total sales that are not adjusted for any discounts, allowances, or returns. They include all types of sales, such as cash, debit or credit card, and trade credit sales.
1343170	If any goods that are purchased are eventually returned, they fall under returns. Our Company typically refunds the complete or partial amount of the goods, and the amount of gross sales is reduced by the amount of the refunds.
1343171	For any goods that are damaged, the company reduces the marked price and sells them at a lower price. The sales of such goods are recorded at a lower price; therefore, the difference between the marked price and the selling price (known as the allowance) is reduced from the gross sales number. 
1343172	Total number of sold products.
1343173	Total cost refers to the aggregation of all types of costs related to a cost object, which means fixed costs, variable costs, and mixed costs. The total cost of our product line includes the variable cost of the goods sold, the costs of advertising the products, running the production line on which the goods are manufactured, and replacing products under the company’s warranty program.
1343174	Offer seasonal discounts to customers on goods purchased. Discounts can also be offered if the customer makes a bulk purchase or makes a payment before the stipulated time. Such discounts are reduced from Gross Sales.
1343175	Discounted Unit Price is the price per unit (Unit Price) where the Discount has been applied. 
1343164	Total Sales volume is the number of units sold within a reporting period. This indicator is monitored by investors to see if a business is expanding or contracting. Within a business, total sales volume is monitored at the level of the product, product line, customer, subsidiary, or sales region. This information is used to alter the investments targeted at any of these areas.

1343163	The purchasing process is the steps a business goes through to complete a transaction. Businesses typically go through a formal process when purchasing something, unlike consumers. Purchases for a business can require research, input from different departments, negotiations and invoicing. Professionals may closely associate the purchasing process with the procurement process. However, the procurement process focuses more on strategies, such as negotiations and researching. The purchasing process focuses on the actual act of buying products and services.
1343152	Customers are important because they drive revenues; without them, businesses cannot continue to exist. All businesses compete with other companies to attract customers, either by aggressively advertising their products, by lowering prices to expand their customer bases, or by developing unique products and experiences that customers love.Customer metrics are measurable data points that provide insights into how customers are interacting with a company's products, services, or brand. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a business in terms of customer acquisition, retention, satisfaction, and loyalty. Customer metrics can be quantitative or qualitative and can include both behavioral and attitudinal measurements.Examples of customer metrics include:Customer acquisition cost (CAC): the cost of acquiring a new customer.Customer lifetime value (CLV): the total value a customer brings to a business over the course of their relationship.Net Promoter Score (NPS): a measure of customer loyalty and satisfaction based on the likelihood of a customer recommending a company to others.Churn rate: the rate at which customers stop using a product or service.Customer satisfaction score (CSAT): a measure of how satisfied customers are with a product or service.Customer retention rate: the percentage of customers who continue to use a product or service over a given period.Average order value (AOV): the average amount spent by customers in a single purchase.Customer engagement: the level of involvement and interaction a customer has with a company's products, services, or brand.
1343179	The company goal: increase year-over-year sales by 10%. Why it’s important: Net Sales is the lifeblood of our company. To ensure profitability and the potential for continued growth, a sales goal based on the number of sold products is vital in our scheme of sales objectives we are trying to create.
1343180	This financial metric provides valuable insights into a company's overall performance, reflecting the effectiveness of its sales strategies and marketing efforts. By analyzing net sales, businesses can identify trends, pinpoint areas for improvement, and make informed decisions to optimize their sales processes and drive growth. Comparing net sales over different periods can also help track the company's progress and assess the impact of specific initiatives or market changes.
1343166	Adventure Works Cycles sells products in four major product categories: bikes, components, clothing, and accessories
1343168	"Price per unit metrics allow marketers to ""calculate meaningful average selling prices within a product line that includes items of different sizes.""Many brands or product lines include multiple models, versions, flavors, colors, sizes, or — more generally – stock-keeping units (SKUs). Brita water filters, for example, are sold in a number of SKUs. They are sold in single-filter packs, double-filter packs, and special banded packs that may be restricted to club stores. They are sold on a standalone basis and in combination with pitchers. These various packages and product forms may be known as SKUs, models, items, and so on. The information gleaned from a price per statistical unit can be helpful in considering price movements within a market. Price per statistical unit, in combination with unit price averages, provides insight into the degree to which the average prices in a market are changing as a result of shifts in 'mix' – proportions of sales generated by differently priced SKUs – versus price changes for individual items. Alterations in mix – such as a relative increase in the sale of larger versus smaller ice cream tubs at retail grocers, for example – will affect average unit price, but not price per statistical unit. Pricing changes in the SKUs that make up a statistical unit, however, will be reflected by a change in the price of that statistical unit."
1343161	The Difference Between Profit and Cash FlowsThe resulting profit may not match the amount of cash flows generated during the same reporting period; this is because some of the accounting transactions required under the accrual basis of accounting do not match cash flows, such as the recordation of depreciation and amortization.Accounting for ProfitsProfit is only accumulated in the accounting records for the current year. After that, the amount of profit reported is shifted into retained earnings, which appears in a company's balance sheet. These retained earnings may be kept within the business to support further growth, or may be distributed to owners in the form of dividends. Retained earnings may also be used to buy back shares.
1343158	Key Takeaways An employee is a worker that performs specific tasks for a business in exchange for regular pay. Employees negotiate a salary with their employer and typically receive benefits, including overtime pay and vacation. Employees differ from independent contractors in that employers take on the financial risk of the venture in exchange for more control over the employee's work.
1343160	Sometimes interchangeable with the term applicant there is a distinguishing difference. Applicant is a job seeker who has applied for a job opening, either by sending a resume or by completing an application. Candidate is the applicant that has been screened and is minimally qualified for the job opening. Candidates are individuals an employer will contact after the application period and conduct some kind of an interview.
1343162	A purchase involves the acquisition of goods or services in exchange for a payment of some kind. The payment is usually in cash or credit (to be paid later). A purchase may also be part of a barter transaction where different non-cash assets are exchanged, or it may be in exchange for the assumption of a liability. Purchasing is a crucial part of the manufacturing process, where raw materials must be acquired and converted into finished goods.Example of a PurchaseShoes Unlimited places an order with a foreign supplier to sell it 10,000 pairs of sneakers. This involves the issuance of a purchase order, which is a legal commitment by the company to acquire the indicated type and quantity of shoes. Once the shoes are delivered, the accounting department wires funds to the supplier in compensation for the delivered goods. This is an example of a purchase.

1343204	Sales Order Entry ProcessThe entire sales order entry process involves various departments, right from sales and customer support, to warehouses and logistics partners.The exact steps and technologies used in sales and purchase order processing can vary, but in general, the sales order entry process follows certain common steps.Step 1: A customer places an order for a product. This order can be placed online, in person, or through the phone. The document generated is known as a purchase order.Step 2: Details of the order and the customer are stored on the database. The customer order is then sent to the warehouse where warehouse managers check if the required products are in stock. A sales order is raised when the company can confirm that they are able to fulfill the order amount with the inventory.Step 3: If the inventory of that particular stock is low or is unavailable, an order is placed to the supplier.Step 4: The purchase order is passed on to the accounts team who tags it under accounts receivable or cash sale. An invoice of sale is raised based on the quantity of the order and sent to the customer.Step 5: A logistics partner will transport the product to the delivery destination and a delivery partner will make the final delivery to the customer’s address.
1343208	1.Customers are well informedToday consumers share and receive information at a much faster pace because of the advancements in technology and communication. They are very well informed about the company, their products, the industry types, the rivals and events. A company should know that the customers study A-Z about a company before making a purchase. Hence you should meet up with their expectations and create a great customer experience through your offerings.2.Customers look for solutionsToday when a customer encounters a small problem, they might end up calling the customer service to get their problem solved. The best customer service should find ways to fix the issues that the customer faces. If you are missing out on quality customer service, you will probably end up losing the customers.3.Customers are social beingsCustomers are social creatures and technology has enabled them to connect more, share more and experience better. Many digital communities are up there to share your views about a particular topic or a product or even an issue. Many customers share their opinions, discuss the possible outcomes and come up with solutions. It is true that almost half the percentage of customers trust an online recommendation more than a brand’s messaging. Hence it is very important for companies to invest in an omni channel environment where they can build engagement with their customers and share their content on a daily basis.4.Customers stay connectedCustomers usually stay connected across multiple channels using multiple devices. You can differentiate the usage and connectivity based on millennials, gen X, gen Y and gen Z. The trends in the social media channels keep changing at a faster pace. Companies need to adapt to these changes and trends , which will help them to be connected with their customers. If you want to reach your customers, you need to curate your content across different channels and platforms.5.Customers are opinionatedCustomers share and receive feedback from others who have already interacted with a brand. These feedbacks might be positive or negative based on the customer experiences. There are many reviews shared each and every time related to a particular product or service. Businesses are conducting surveys and questionnaires in order to hear the opinions from customers to curate their experiences in a better way.
1343209	1.Loyal customersLoyal customers are the top priority customer groups and an important segment to appease. Usually these customers represent 20% of the customer base and also contribute to the major portion of revenue for the company. Loyal customers purchase products or services over a longer period of time and are likely to be brand advocates for the company. The businesses should also obtain feedback from the customers in order to grow the business to a next level.2.Impulse customersThese are the second most attractive segment of customers identified by the businesses. You can effectively upsell or cross sell to these customers. Impulse customers buy products and services spontaneously triggered by an impulse. They don’t have a shopping list at hand while purchasing. Impulse customers respond to the recommendations and offers. You need to devise strategies to capture these customers in order to make impulse purchases.3.Discount customersDiscount customers play a key role in upbringing the company’s inventory. The discount customers contribute to the cash flow of the company. These customers look for discounts, seasonal offers and festive offers. Upselling or cross selling to these customers would be a bit difficult and they are considered to be less loyal towards the company.4.Need based customersNeed based customers buy products or services driven by a particular need. They come with a shopping list based on their needs and quickly purchase those products from the store. It is quite difficult to upsell to these customers and they are also less loyal to the business. If their need is satisfied better by the competitor’s products they will switch to substitute products easily. In order to retain such customers, you need to develop interaction and a positive bond with these customer segments. There is a possibility of converting need based customers to loyal customers by building strong positive relationships.5.Wandering customersWandering customers are those customers that make up the crowd in the mall or a shopping complex. They have no specific need/ preference in their mind and just wander the stores for some enjoyment or relaxation. They in particular do not contribute to the profitability of the company. The customers might love the ambience of the store and might stay there just randomly looking for products. These customer segments do not contribute much to the profit of the business. The business can still provide insightful information to these customers to stimulate interest, which might potentially end up in a purchase.
1343211	Each employee has a specific job to accomplish that is often defined by a job description. In responsible organizations, a performance development planning process defines the work of the employee and the organization’s expectation’s for the employee’s performance. It should also help employees set goals and track their performance. Additionally, the performance management system should help employees develop their ongoing skills and adopt a career path. An employee works within a functional area or department such as marketing or human resources.An employee has a boss, the person they report to and take direction from—usually a manager or supervisor. An employee should have the expectation that they will receive reasonable, professional treatment from the manager. An employee also has coworkers who work with them to accomplish the work of the department. The employee has a workstation or an office in which they accomplish the job. The employer supplies the employee with the tools and equipment necessary to perform work such as a computer, telephone, cell phone, laptop, desk, and supplies. In forward-thinking organizations, the employee receives frequent performance feedback from the manager, rewards and recognition, and a reasonable benefits package.
1343212	Most important difference are listed in this table: EmployeeContractorBehaviorEmployer controls what and howDetermined by contractorFinancesEmployer primarily responsibleContractor primarily responsibleRelationshipWork is key to businessWork is not key to businessThe difference between an employee and an independent contractor can be nuanced. They both perform tasks for a business in exchange for payment. A business trying to determine whether a worker is an employee or a contractor can consider three factors. There isn't a set threshold at which a worker becomes one or the other. Businesses must carefully consider all relevant factors to decide how to treat a worker.
1343213	What is an exempt employee? An exempt employee meets certain thresholds that disqualify them from overtime benefits covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The most common type of exempt employee is a salaried (non-hourly) worker receiving at least $684 per week. Certain professions, such as computer workers, have lower thresholds. Other types of employees, such as teachers and medical professionals, are not subject to these salary thresholds.What is a 1099 employee? A 1099 worker isn't an employee at all; they're an independent contractor. Rather than filling out a W-4 and using a W-2 for tax returns, independent contractors fill out a W-9 and use a 1099 form for tax returns.What is a non-exempt employee? A non-exempt employee must receive overtime pay under certain conditions. Many employees fall into this category, and they typically receive extra pay when working more than 40 hours per week (subject to state law).
1343215	1. Identify the needThe purchasing process begins when the business recognizes that they have a need for a product, tool or service that will enhance their operations. Team members can help identify needs as they complete their daily work by notifying their supervisors of any challenges they encounter. Once the organization identifies a need, they can begin the purchasing process.2. Specify the requirementDuring this stage, leaders investigate the need further and come up with a plan for exactly what they require. For example, a frequent shortage of printer paper becomes the need for weekly deliveries of 500 sheets of inkjet printer paper to ensure a continuous supply. The person who identified the need often works with other team members and management to come up with the right solution to the problem, especially when concerning a larger purchase. For example, the employee who identified the need for more printer paper may have the power to specify the requirement on their own, while the need for new computer systems throughout the entire office likely requires input from others.3. Find and choose a supplierFind potential suppliers who can provide the specific product or service you want to purchase. You can conduct your own research online or contact those in your professional network to ask for recommendations. If shipping costs are a factor in your purchase, look for businesses in your local area. During this stage, it is a good idea to consider several suppliers and compare them against one another. When necessary, contact the supplier and request a quote or proposal from them. As you are considering suppliers, consider factors such as cost, reliability and delivery time.4. Negotiate costsIn many situations, it is possible to negotiate costs with a supplier, especially when placing high-priced orders or orders you expect to recur regularly. Contact the supplier you are considering and ask if they are open to negotiating the price. Suppliers may negotiate if it means they can secure a large or long-term contract for their business.5. Get order approvalBefore your business can initiate the transaction, you may need to get approval for the order. This could include working with upper management and the accounting department to ensure there are enough available funds within the budget for the purchase. In some scenarios, the business may also need to establish a line of credit with the supplier. If you haven't already, explain to management why this purchase is necessary and how you achieved a reasonable price from the supplier.6. Place the orderOnce both sides agree to the transaction, you can formally place the order. Have both sides agree to the specific details, such as price, delivery times, fees and installations. Get everything in writing and have representatives from both organizations sign it. Then keep a copy of this agreement in your files for future reference.7. Receive and approve the orderWhen the order arrives, check for any issues with the product or anything the supplier failed to deliver on. Timeliness is key because if there are any problems, the supplier should address them before you release the rest of the payment.8. Review supplier performanceWhether you work with a supplier on a onetime transaction or set up recurring transactions, make it a regular practice to review your suppliers' deliveries for quality and timeliness. A record of these reviews can help you identify and track any issues that might arise later in your contract. Continue relationships with suppliers who continue to meet your business' needs.Automate the purchasing processWhenever possible, look to implement purchasing process automation. With purchase automation software, businesses can shorten the purchasing life cycle, lessen the workload of those involved, reduce errors and limit paperwork. Purchase automation software is particularly useful if your business makes a lot of recurring purchases from the same suppliers.Keep reliable recordsThroughout the purchasing process, keep reliable records. This includes records of potential suppliers, negotiations, sales, returns and any other transactions. There may come a time when you want to consider another supplier or have a dispute with your existing supplier. Keeping reliable records on every stage of the purchasing process helps reduce future issues and workloads.Regularly review your needsA business's needs change all the time. Sometimes a business needs something entirely new, while other times it needs a different version of something it is already getting. Make it a regular practice throughout your business to analyze what you currently need and whether what you are buying is meeting those needs. By regularly checking in on your operations, you can identify and address needs sooner, allowing your business to grow while making effective spending decisions.
1343218	Step 1. Calculate Core EarningsRather than bothering with the net profit margin at all, use the core earnings formula to strip away a number of areas that are commonly used to modify earnings. Accordingly, strip away the following items from the initial profit figure:Asset impairment chargesCosts related to merger activitiesCosts related to the issuance of bonds and other forms of financingGains or losses on hedging activities that have not yet been realizedGains or losses on the sale of assetsGains or losses related to the outcome of litigationProfits or losses from pension incomeRecognized cost of stock options issued to employeesRecognized cost of warrants issued to third partiesAccrued cost of restructuring operations that have not yet occurredStep 2. Deflate Core EarningsUse the deflated profit growth calculation to adjust the core earnings figure for inflation, which will reduce the reported profit figure. To do so, follow these steps:Divide the price index for the prior reporting period by the price index for the current reporting period; thenMultiply the result by the net profit figure reported for the current reporting period; thenSubtract the net profits for the prior reporting period from the result; and finallyDivide the result by the net profit figure for the prior reporting period.Step 3. Create a Trend LineRun the deflated core earnings figure back in time for several years. This gives the best indication of whether management is actually able to generate improvements in profitability over time. It is entirely possible that an initially favorable profit trend is actually a declining trend, once the preceding adjustments have been made. It can be useful for the analyst to discuss the outcome of this profit analysis with management.Doing so may yield some valid issues that should be incorporated into the analysis. It may also reveal that company managers have, in fact, been using accounting shenanigans to adjust reported profits. Limitations of Profit Analysis Profit analysis is strictly historical in nature; it does not take into account the future prospects of a business. Thus, a business might be investing in new technology, driving down its current earnings in order to benefits its future profits, and profit analysis will not make note of this fact.In addition, profit analysis does not examine the constraints within a business to determine what is holding it back from generating more profits. An additional limitation of profit analysis is that it does not account for where products are located in their life cycles, so it cannot predict when their sales will decline, leading to a drop in profits.
1343226	The cost of acquiring a new customer.
1343226	CAC  measures the amount of money a business spends to acquire a new customer. CAC takes into account all the costs associated with customer acquisition, such as marketing and advertising expenses, sales and customer service costs, and any other related expenses.CAC is an important metric for businesses because it helps them understand how much they need to spend to acquire new customers, which can inform their marketing and sales strategies. It also allows businesses to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of their customer acquisition efforts and make decisions about where to allocate their resources.Calculation:To calculate CAC, a business takes its total customer acquisition costs over a given period and divides that by the total number of new customers acquired during the same period.COSTS / NEW CUSTOMERSExample: For example, if a business spends $50,000 on marketing and sales activities over a quarter and acquires 500 new customers during that time, the CAC would be $100 ($50,000 / 500 = $100).
1343228	The total value a customer brings to a business over the course of their relationship.
1343228	CLV measures the total value a customer brings to a business over the course of their relationship. CLV takes into account the revenue a customer generates, as well as any associated costs such as marketing and customer service expenses, to provide an estimate of the total value of a customer over time.CLV is an important metric for businesses because it allows them to understand the long-term value of a customer and make decisions about how to allocate their resources. Businesses can use CLV to identify their most valuable customers and focus their retention efforts on those customers, or to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of their marketing and customer acquisition efforts. CLV is also useful for forecasting future revenue and growth potential, as it provides an estimate of the revenue a business can expect to generate from its existing customer base.CalculationTo calculate CLV, a business takes the revenue generated by a customer over their entire relationship with the business and subtracts any associated costs. This calculation can be complex and may involve predicting future customer behavior, such as the likelihood of repeat purchases or referrals, and discounting future revenue and costs to their present value.
